Pet project projects for learning about topics.
The goal is to implement topics only using python build in
functions without relying on dependencies. That means
the code will not be optimized and is not meant to be run
in production. Topics I hope to cover include

- Backprop
- Tokenization
- syntax parsing
- auto-complete
- automatic theorem proving
